<p>
    Famous as the ‘Lagoon of Darkness’ among tourists and an absolute delight among hard core nature 
    photographers, Andhakaranazhi is a gorgeous beach located 31 kms from Alleppey on the Kochi-Alleppey 
    route and is one of the most beautiful places to visit near Alleppey. Housing the super pretty Manakkodam 
    lighthouse, the beach is where the backwaters and the Arabian Sea merge and the phenomenon is a sight 
    in itself, especially at the time of sunset and sunrise.
