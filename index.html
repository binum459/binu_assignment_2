        <h1>Kerala:God's own country</h1>
        <p>Known as the “God’s Own Country”, Kerala is surely one of the most beautiful places in India.
        Kerala or Keralam is a Malayalee word made up of two parts; ‘Kera’ meaning coconut and ‘alam’ meaning land.
        The land of coconut trees is a destination that has something for every kind of traveller.
        Whether you want to sail the glistening backwaters or lose yourself in the mystical coastal greenery,
        Kerala is an ultimate tourist destination to experience bliss and serenity.</p>

        Kerala tourism will surprise you with several options to explore this tropical bliss in different ways. 
        Float along on the backwaters of Alleppey, Periyar and Munnar and experience cloud nine while you take

        The best way to explore the backwaters is to sail on a quaint Kerala house boat. 
        For the ones who find serenity in the woods, trek through Wayanad’s lush green jungles. 
        You can join various trekking groups and camp in the green woods under the stars with a group of fellow

        tours. These tours often consist of Ayurvedic therapies, food and yoga.</p>

        

    <h3>Kerala Culture</h3>
    <p> Kerala’s culture is influenced by three major religions of the state – Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. 
    The state livens up during all the major festivals celebrated by the people of these three faiths.
    If you are the artsy traveller, Kerala’s art and culture will nurture your artistic soul. 
    Witness magnificent Kathakali and Mohiniattam performances when in Kerala and cherish the true cultural 
    heritage of this land. Kathakali is the Indian classical dance form that depicts Indian epics and is 
    recognised by UNESCO as the Intangible Cultural Heritage. Mohiniattam is a graceful and feminine dance 
    form and emotes a play through music and dance. Whether you are fond of dance or not, you are sure to 
    lose yourself in these enticing and mesmerising dance performances.
    Kerala proudly upholds its local sounds and music. Music aficionados can head to a Carnatic music session and 
    groove to the hypnotic tunes of Tanpura and Nadaswaram. Apart from music and dance, Kerala culture is also 
    enriched with lively festivals. Onam is the most renowned and the biggest of all the festivals. 
    It’s the harvest festival celebrated in the month of August or September. 
    To experience Kerala in all its glory, join the Onam celebrations and relish the festive food and enjoy the
    spectacular ‘pulikali’ performance (the dance of the tigers).</p>
