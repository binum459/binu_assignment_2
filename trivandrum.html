    Located adjacent to Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Kuthiramalika Palace Museum is the rarest specimen of workmanship.
     Built by Maharaja Swathi Balarama Varma, this palace displays valuable collections of royal family.
Beside the rich collection that it displays, this museum is an exemplary example of traditional 
Travancore-style architecture.  Intricate wood carvings and distinctive patterns constitute a masterpiece of
 its kinds. Overhanging attics, pillar-lined courtyards and sloping roofs contribute to the exclusive look of 
 the museum.Visitors can expect a display of a collection, including Belgian mirrors, paintings, Kathakali 
 mannequins, exquisite traditional furniture. The two royal thrones; one manufactured of Bohemian crystals, 
 embossed with an emblem of ‘Conch’ on the backrest and the other made of ivory are the prime attractions of
  the museum. Marble-made idols and sculptures, musical instruments and the alcove used by Swami Thirunal 
  have also been kept in the showcase. An illusion portrait by veteran painter Sveroslav Roerich is another 
  attractive feature here.
