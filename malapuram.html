<p>
    A famous Muslim Pilgrimage in the Malappuram district, Mamburam is a shrine dedicated to the dead bodies
     of some of the primary Thangals of Kerala. It was a title given to the Arabs from Yemen who scattered 
     from there and migrated to Kerala. They held great importance to the locals of Kerala and thus, had this 
     shrine dedicated to them. A local festival held here during the time of Muharram is one of the primary 
     attractions of this place.

     birds, and about 60 species of migratory birds.This includes Whimbrels, brahminy kites, terns, seagulls, 
     sand plovers, sandpipers, green shanks and turn stones, all of whom appear to their respective seasons.
